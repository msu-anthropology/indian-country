          <p>Along the southwest coast of what is now Alaska, the Yup’ik people call various villages on the Yukon River, known as <em>Kwiqpak</em> in Yup’ik, home. In their early history, intertribal wars between the Yupiit and Athabascans farther inland caused some Yup’ik groups to move out of the Yukon River area, but they eventually returned. Regardless of this migration, as an Inuit group they have lived in Alaska for thousands of years, forming their own cultural identity with shared values and practices. In Yup’ik belief, humans and all other living beings were created by the spirit of the universe, <em>Ellam Yua</em>. Along with this comes various values and rules shaped by these beliefs and stories <a href="#Sources">(Ayunerak et al. 2014)</a>. Many of the Yup'ik settlements that were established hundreds of years ago have become the Yup’ik villages of today.</p>

          <p>First colonized by Russia in 1741, Alaska was sold to the United States of America in 1867. The Indian Reorganization Act (IRA) of 1934 was used to create formal reserves similar to the Native American reservations of the lower 48 states, but of the six established, only one still exists today. Due to the discovery of oil and the new statehood of Alaska, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) of 1971 created multiple for-profit corporations, the Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) and Alaska Native Village Corporations (ANVCs), of which Alaska Natives became shareholders and were able to vote to acquire land <a href="#Sources">(Harvard Project 2008)</a>. This was done so that the land is fee simple (privately owned), meaning that there is a lack of restrictions on land use, allowing for the extraction of natural resources.  While this act did not affect land owned by Alaska Natives through previous allotments, land conveyed to tribes and villages through these corporations is not considered to be part of Indian Country, meaning that the land has no significant use restrictions and that tribes have limited power to exercise jurisdiction over non-tribe members on this land <a href="#Sources">(Forbes 2023)</a>.</p>
          <p>Due to ANCSA, tribal membership in Alaska is defined based on villages rather than tribal identity, unlike the rest of the USA. However, this definition by the government complicates that there <em>are</em> shared Indigenous identities, as can be seen with the Yup’ik. Historically they did have permanent settlements, but also traveled to various camps for seasonal harvesting. Many families would migrate, following different food sources with this seminomadic lifestyle <a href="#Sources">(Ayunerak et al. 2014)</a>. Both the previous Allotment Act and ANCSA are an attempt to recognize Native land claims and respect this migratory way of life, while also settling what land is owned and can be used by the state of Alaska <a href="#Sources">(Forbes 2023)</a>. Hunting, gathering and fishing are still an important part of subsistence in contemporary Yup’ik populations, but many now live a more settled lifestyle in the established villages <a href="#Sources">(Harvard Project 2008; Ayunerak et al. 2014)</a>.</p>
          <p>Like in the rest of the US, when Alaska was acquired various policies were implemented, including those aiming to “civilize” American Indians and Alaska Natives. One of these was the creation of boarding schools, which were common throughout the USA and Canada. These boarding schools were created starting in the 1800s by the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) or private churches for the specific purpose of “Christianizing” and assimilating Native Americans into the dominant Euro-American culture <a href="#Sources">(Harvard Project 2008)</a>. Well into the 20th century, most Native Alaskan communities did not have local high schools or access to nearby secondary education, necessitating the use of these boarding schools. Many students were even sent to boarding schools outside of Alaska due to the limited number in the state becoming full. It was only in 1976 that the state of Alaska built high schools in rural Native communities, based on a legal case that claimed racial discrimination, and so the era of boarding schools in Alaska came to a close <a href="#Sources">(Hirschberg and Sharp 2005)</a>. However, this does not mean that the legacy of these schools and other assimilation efforts are not still felt today.</p>

      <h3>The Complex Roots of Domestic Violence</h3>
       <hr>
           <p>For many indigenous communities, especially in rural areas such as Alaska, the issue of Domestic violence, is one that is incredibly complex and is affected by generations of trauma and structural violence against Native and Indigenous peoples. It must be noted that the normalization of domestic violence, especially against women and children, is a uniquely colonial concept, and this assists in understanding the generational trauma from boarding schools with the intent to indoctrinate indigenous children with western beliefs and behaviors would play a role. However, the circumstances of domestic violence surrounding Alaskan communities, and especially rural communities are uniquely difficult given the environment in which many of these individuals live. The cases of domestic violence, are different and vary from individual to individual, however, it is worthwhile to take into account how the Alaskan environment plays a significant role in the experiences of domestic violence survivors as well as the shelters and services that work to combat it, and help those affected heal.</p> 
           <figure style="padding-right:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; float: left; width: 40%">
            <img src="https://www.calistacorp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Emmonak-IMG_2630EDIT-300x207.jpg" width="100%">
            <figcaption><a href="#Sources">Image 2. Emmonak Alaska in the Winter</a></figcaption>
           </figure>
           <p>The development of domestic violence is not something that is a natural occurrence, especially in indigenous communities. The long history of trauma of violence against indigenous people in America, and more recently with the horrific experiences of western boarding schools, has severely changed the dynamics between the traditional relationships between men and women, as well as dismantled the tools of self-control <a href="#Sources">(Shinkwin, 1983)</a>. The indoctrination of Western culture has caused a disruption in the social cohesion in these communities, and by returning to traditional practices of self-control and healing can indigenous communities begin to heal.</p>
           <p>Furthermore, for many, the land and weather play a detrimental factor in the escape from domestic violence; for much of the Alaskan winter, the weather becomes an integral part of the distinction between existing in the environment and living in it. Given the landscape of Alaska, the ability to travel is limited. “...rurality in Alaska differs from other states in that many villages are not on a road system and are accessible only by plane, boat, snow machine, or dog sled.” <a href="#Sources">(Shepherd, 2001)</a>. Combined with the extreme weather conditions, the travel systems in rural Alaska hold a significant role in how domestic violence victims are unable to leave dangerous situations, and why it may take a public safety officer or a state trooper hours before they are able to assist in an unsafe situation.</p>
           <p>The sources of domestic violence and the ability to escape from the dangerous circumstances that occur from it are struggles faced by many communities but this highlights the significance of indigenous community and healing. In rural Alaskan communities, a Women’s shelter that is run for and by indigenous women in that community plays an important role in recognizing the specific struggle that is faced by women in these rural communities. This is especially important given the isolation that occurs as a result of the weather and the importance of the impact of having shelters and services with the intention of focusing on providing care that is based on indigenous practices and beliefs with the treacherous landscape.</p>

        <h3>Legal Issues</h3>
         <hr>
            <p>While the landscape is a significant part of the struggle faced by domestic violence victims, it is also the lack of legal assistance both in terms of law enforcement and laws specifically for domestic violence victims, that exacerbate the turmoil that victims and survivors face. The treatment by the government and law enforcement of Native Americans and Alaska Native peoples has a history of violence and blatant disregard for crimes against indigenous communities, and this is seen within the circumstances faced by Native Alaskan communities. It was not until the past three decades that legal action to prosecute crimes against American Indigenous and Alaskan Native peoples. </p>
            <p>A large problem facing the safety and prosecution of criminals who commit acts of violence against Alaskan Native women is the severe lack of law enforcement and their capabilities. Given the rurality and isolation that many of these villages face, there is often no state trooper or public safety office in the area- and that even when there is a public safety officer, they are not respected or they often quit <a href="#Sources">(Shepherd, 2001)</a>. While there may be laws in place to protect those who are victims of domestic abuse there is no legal accountability, which marks the importance of legislation being brought forth to establish more protections for Alaska Native women and prosecution for the perpetrators of domestic violence. </p>

             </figure>
            <p>Beginning in 1994, congress passed the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a law meant to recognize crimes of domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking with reauthorization in 2000, 2005, and 2013. When the law was first instated it was an attempt to “...improve tribal crime reporting, expand tribal jurisdiction over crimes committed on reservation lands, strengthen communication between tribal and nontribal agencies, and increasing funding for tribal programs and services for victims of sexual violence.” <a href="#Sources">(Yuan, 2015)</a>.  The progression of legislation is an important factor in how victims of domestic violence may reach out for help, as well as how programs and services are able to work to the best of their ability. </p>
            <p>The reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2022 introduced the Special Domestic Violence Criminal Jurisdiction (SDVCJ), which was originally barred from Alaskan tribes; this implementation is meant to “...hold the perpetrators of violence against Alaska Native women criminally accountable.” <a href="#Sources">(Watson, 2023).</a> This implantation was specifically designed to be recognized in tribal courts, and while there is a lot that still needs to be done, it is a step forward in establishing indigenous based healing and legal processes to help victims of domestic abuse.</p>

        <h3>Community Action</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>The Yup’ik Women’s Coalition (YWC) is a nonprofit organization that is working to end violence against Alaska Native women and children through culturally relevant education and programs. According to their website, this includes the strengthening of traditional Yup’ik beliefs and teachings. They serve various communities along the Yukon River, including the village of Emmonak <a href="#Sources">(YWC n.d.)</a>. This is where the Emmonak Women’s Shelter is based, providing a safe place from domestic violence for women and children from the surrounding villages:</p>
        <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/83089663?h=94ea82938c" width="500" height="315" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Domestic abuse is common in Yup’ik communities, especially in connection with the issues brought by colonialism <a href="#Sources">(Andre 2013)</a>. Due to the insufficiency of law enforcement, particularly in rural areas, the Emmonak Women’s Shelter has worked to train “victim resource advocates” who connect those who have experienced violence with the shelter and other resources. Often, these villages do not have roads that connect them to other communities, and many women do not want to go to law enforcement, so these advocates will take women and children into their homes in emergency situations. Unfortunately, this can create dangerous situations if the perpetrator of the violence decides to come for the family <a href="#Sources">(Stremple 2023)</a>. The women’s shelter then gives families a safe place to stay and have a sense of community with others going through the same hardships <a href="#Sources">(Andre 2013)</a>. In an interview with Alaska Native women at a battered women’s shelter, many women spoke about the respite that the shelter provides, especially as it is run mainly by fellow Indigenous women and is based on cultural practices. In one instance, one of the shelter coordinators spoke about the implementation of a fish camp, “We got a fish camp because we had to. We needed it for the kids. If women have something to do, it's healing. Natives know there are other ways to heal than just to talk in an office. Cleaning fish and talking and just spending time together is healing. In the old days, people could take long walks on the tundra.” <a href="#Sources">(Shepherd 2001)</a>. It is important to look at the practices of specific villages and tribes to create programs that work with individuals in a way that coincides with their beliefs and traditions.</p>

          </figure>
        <p>In Yup’ik culture, community and kinship are very important, but due to assimilation efforts like the boarding schools many of these values have been lost over the generations. Prior to the arrival of missionaries, spirituality had a prominent role in everyday life. Traditionally, the <em>qasgiq</em> was a sacred building in the center of each Yup’ik village, which was used for ceremonial and entertainment purposes, as well as communal living.  Today, these structures are no longer created. During colonization, they were deemed improper and immoral, and the building of single-family homes was encouraged. The pervasive assimilation efforts of the time served to disrupt the extended family relations that were previously common, as well as traditional religious beliefs and practices. The <em>qasgiq</em> does still exist, however, but in the form of an action. Many Yup’ik communities use <em>qasgiq</em> to refer to gatherings, no matter their specific location <a href="#Sources">(Rasmus et al. 2019)</a>. These gatherings still serve a ceremonial purpose, as a place to teach <em>Yuuyaraaq</em>, the Yup’ik way of life or Yup'ik values, as well as for <em>Yuraq</em> (also known as Eskimo dancing). Loss of language due to the assimilation efforts of boarding schools is also something that distanced Yupiit from these teachings, as their context and meanings cannot be fully understood without an understanding of the Yup’ik language <a href="#Sources">(Ayunerak et al. 2014)</a>. It is through this method that community and beliefs can be reestablished</p>
        <p>What the Yup’ik Women’s Coalition and the Emmonak Women’s Shelter, among other organizations, are looking to do is reestablish traditional community and kinship relations in order to solve the issue of violence against women and children. In the documentary <a href="https://vimeo.com/82467170">Daughters of Emmonak</a>, the domestic violence issues that Yupiit face are connected to societal issues brought by colonization, primarily alcohol abuse <a href="#Sources">(Andre 2013)</a>. While <em>qasgiq</em> help to reestablish traditional beliefs and relationships, they are also a way of addressing issues within communities, including alcoholism and domestic abuse. The goal is to teach members of the community, especially young people, cultural values and practices that help to resist and resolve these various problems. Yup’ik Indigenous knowledge, defined as “Unique world views and associated knowledge systems integrating core values, beliefs, and practices of the culture and its people.” <a herf="#Sources">(Rasmus et al. 2019)</a>, is incorporated into these solutions. <em>Yupiit</em>, the plural of Yup’ik, means “real people of the land”, and belief in <em>Ellam Yua</em> teaches that all living things need to be respected, because everything is connected. Part of this connection is to the land and living things, but also includes relationship structures between people. Prior to the assimilation efforts, the role of different people within communities as well as different types of community were clearly defined, and the knowledge and recognition of these connections has been lost. In Yup’ik teachings this respect is meant to extend to the relationships between men and women, as well as between parents and children <a href="#Sources">(Ayunerak et al 2014)</a>. Overall, these meetings and community interactions facilitated by organizations like the Yup’ik Women’s Coalition are a large part of the effort to strengthen traditional familial and kin relationships and rediscover the idea that everything and everyone is connected, as well as healing through community</p>

        <h3>Moving Forward</h3>
        <hr> 
         <p>The issues facing women who suffer from domestic violence are immense, and this is even more so for Alaska Native Women. The generational trauma and lack of government assistance has for many years left these communities with no respite. However, within the past few decades progress has been made to pave the way for a better future. It has been through Indigenous and Native-led programs and services like the Yup’ik Women’s Coalition and Emmonak Women’s Shelter that many Alaska Native women have been able to find a source of healing and a safe location through their own traditions and beliefs. This reestablishment of traditional community relationships also helps to serve as culturally relevant prevention of issues like domestic violence. By supporting and uplifting Native-led and Native-based organizations villages and tribes are given the opportunity to help victims and are able to prosecute perpetrators through new legislation.</p>
