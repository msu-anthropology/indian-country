          <p>The state of California is home to the largest number of Indigenous people in the United States (California Tribal Communities, n.d), but lacks reliable data on missing and murdered Native women. This project's goal is to investigate the history surrounding missing and murdered Indigenous women (MMIW) in California, highlight the modern implicaations of the issue, and understand how the legislation surrounding MMIW and Indigenous nations have enabled these atrocities to continue. </p>

	          <h3>Historical Overview of Native Settlements in CA</h3>
        <hr>
          <p> Though Indigenous peoples occupied California for thousands of years prior to colonization, the earliest documented contact with these nations came with the arrival of Spanish conquistadors. Though the Spanish had invaded much of Central and South America in the 16th and 17th century, they did not begin to colonize modern California until the late 18th century, which began with the establishment of a presidio (fort) and mission in San Diego in 1769 (Spanish California, n.d.). From there, the Spanish continued to push north, establishing more missions and deliberately exposing Indigenous people to myriad forms of violence and illnesses. The goal of these missions was to convert (rarely voluntarily) the local Indigenous population to Christianity and to teach them Western skills. These goals were achieved by imprisonment, forced labor, abuse (especially towards women), and disease.</p>
<p>When the Spanish landed in California, the Native population was estimated to be around 310,000 (Five views, n.d.). By the time the mission system had been abolished in 1834, the Native population now hovered around 150,000 (The Missions, n.d.). Today, 660,000 California residents identify as Native American (Visit Native California, n.d.). Relatively speaking, this number is incredibly low as it only represents 1.7% of the state’s population. The Spanish mission system laid the groundwork for the decimation of Native peoples, then handed the United States the baton.</p>
<p>The horrific treatment of native nations was not exclusive to the Spanish; Indigenous nations would—and still do—face calculated and often violent attempts by the US government to eliminate Native people altogether.</p> 
<p>Spanish colonialism in California set the precedent for how Indigenous peoples would be treated in the future: a group to be exploited. The behavior of conquistadors towards native women (often sexually violent) mirrors what we see today with the issue of MMIW. The history of colonial California is incredibly important when looking at the issue of missing and murdered Indigenous women because it continues to repeat itself. Though the authoritative power in modern day (the US government) does not directly abuse these women, it facilitates violence towards them through a history of neglect and inadequate justice.</p>

        <h3>Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women in the United States</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Indigenous women make up 1.1% of the United States population (Native American, n.d.). But, according to the Association of American Indian Affairs, Indigenous women “2.5 times as likely to experience violent crimes and 2 times as likely to experience rape or sexual assault than all other races” (Violence Against Native Peoples, n.d.). These cases of violence against native women are collectively referred to as Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women (MMIW). But, there is very little reliable data on the actual number of MMIW cases, as many cases are dismissed before they are even opened. When a friend or loved one goes missing, native nations’ pleas for justice are rarely heard. The US government, specifically the state of California, for this project, chooses not to listen.<p>
            <figure style="padding-right:20px; padding-bottom: 5px; float: left; width: 20%">
             <img src="img/SOCIAL_MEDIA_IMAGE.jpg" width="100%">
             <figcaption><a href="#ImageSource">Image 2. MMIW Graphic</a></figcaption>
            </figure>
         <h3>The Legality of MMIW</h3> 
         <p>In the past, the US government has passed numerous laws and issued many verdicts that grant itself jurisdiction over parts of Indian country. In Public Law 280, Congress decreed that criminal jurisdiction over offenses committed by or against Indigenous people would be in the hands of the state government (Appendix A, n.d.). This transfer of jurisdiction was mandatory in six states, including California. While Public Law 280 did allow for some tribes to be excluded from state jurisdiction, no tribes were excluded in California, placing all 109 federally recognized tribes under the power of the state (California Tribal Communities, n.d.). This means that even in a crime committed against an Indigenous person on native land, the state of California would have jurisdiction over the case. This law effectively undermines the sovereignty of native nations, as it strips tribal governments of the right to prosecute crimes committed against their own people, on their own land. Though tribal governments have limited authority already, laws like Public Law 280 dramatically reduce the ability of native governments to protect their own people and lands. Additionally, until recently, tribal governments were unable to prosecute non-native individuals, even though they commit 96% of violent crimes against native women (Ending Violence Against Native Women, n.d.). Legislation like this directly contributes to the staggering number of MMIW cases. No one is more motivated to seek justice than the affected communities. So, when native nations lack authority over cases regarding their own people, the state government is telling native nations that they are unequal in the eyes of the law. They reinforce the idea that tribal governments are ineffective and that their missing and murdered women and girls are insignificant, unworthy of true justice. </p>

	<p>During the last two centuries, many laws have been passed to protect Indigenous people, especially Indigenous women and girls. According to the Association on American Indian Affairs, “84.3 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in their lifetime” (Violence Against Native Peoples, n.d.). In response to the disproportionate rate of violence against Indigenous women and girls, the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) was passed in 1995. In general, VAWA seeks to decrease the amount of violent crimes against women, allow Indian tribal governments to exercise their sovereign authority surrounding these crimes, and hold these criminals accountable for their actions (Violence Against Women Act, n.d.).</p> 
	<p>When it comes to cases of MMIW, the first and foremost issue is the perpetrators. But the second lies in federalism. One of the reasons Indigenous women continue to face such horrible realities is because of what happens after the crime is committed. Federalism, by definition, is the sharing of powers between multiple levels of government. In these situations, that involves the state and tribal governments, and oftentimes the federal government as well. Federalism, furthered by Public Law 280, is the reason why so many MMIW cases fall through the cracks. Even now, over two centuries after the establishment of federalism, state and federal governments struggle to share jurisdiction. When tribal governments are added into the mix, the friction only increases.</p>
  <p>Another reason MMIW cases are so common stems from the lack of prosecution. Inadequate prosecution almost always comes back to the question of authority. For a long time, the federal government assumed full authority over any and all Indigenous issues, mostly choosing to ignore them. Gradually, states were given power, especially in California where the state government has mandated authority over Indigenous issues. Women have faced disproportionate levels of violence almost continuously throughout recorded history, and Indigenous women face violence at levels far more frequent than any other demographic, but these issues are infrequently prosecuted and rarely result in convictions or other forms of closure. Protections like VAWA, though they mean well, have enabled this violence toward Indigenous women. Though introduced in 1994, Indigenous women were not specifically protected by VAWA until 2005 (Gilbert et al., 2021). And, even after that, tribal governments still faced many restrictions when trying to prosecute crimes in their own jurisdiction. “It wasn’t until the 2013 VAWA reauthorization that restrictions on tribal authority to prosecute some violence against Indigenous women on Indian reservations were repealed, though some of these restrictions still exist today” (Gilbert et al., 2021). Restrictions against tribal governments are how the US government keeps violence against Indigenous women legal. By suppressing the affected community, criminals and other perpetrators know there are few consequences for targeting this demographic, so MMIW cases never cease.</p>
  <p>Overall, the United States has enabled MMIW cases by letting those cases fall through jurisdictional cracks. More and more protections for Indigenous women are being pushed forward, but those protections only do their job if they can be backed up with real justice. By stripping tribal governments of their authority to investigate and prosecute and giving the state of California the rights to deal with Indigenous issues, the US government has failed Indigenous women again. To counteract this, the US government and state of California need to remove restrictions on tribal governments and let Indigenous women know that their cases aren’t just heard, but will be properly investigated and their offenders will be truly brought to justice.</p>

          <h3>Personal Testimonies and Representation in the Media</h3>
            <p>Although numerous social factors explain the MMIW issue, the impact of intimate partner violence(IPV) should not be ignored. A common form of violence against women is IPV, which refers to abusive and controlling behavior that be emotional, physical, financial, sexual, and so on- perpetuated by a current or previous intimate partner onto the other(Breiding et. al. 2015). According to an annual report by the Violence Policy Center (2019), data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s(FBI) Supplementary Homicide Reports show that 92% of female victims were murdered by someone they knew and 62% of these cases were perpetrated by a current husband, ex-husband, or boyfriend at the time of the offense. This statistic alone is a key indicator of the likelihood of potential perpetrators for many MMIW cases around California and the nation.
<p>
            <p>Active evidence and research suggest that missing and victimized non-white women and girls receive less media attention and coverage than their white counterparts(see for example (slackoff, 2020). In addition to this, the lack of attention is problematic for indigenous women and girls because- when a missing person’s case receives media attention- the pressure is placed on the police to allocate their time and resources to locate the missing individual(Kassab, 2012). Without this pressure, the police would feel as inclined to locate the missing individuals in a safe, timely manner that may prevent any further violence on the victim from occurring. 
In truth, the invisibility of Indigenous women and girl victims in the media mirrors the invisibility of Indigenous issues more broadly. In rare instances where missing indigenous women and people are represented in the media, it is problematic through defamation of the victim or the tribe affected. Of the California cases classified as murders, law enforcement solved 9%, researchers found (Sault 2023). It is even noted that when records are available, Native Women in the state are often misclassified as white, or their deaths were labeled accidental even when family and friends thought otherwise.

              </figure>
</p>
            <p>Under current legislation within the state level, or at least within the past 2 years, only 10 states require law enforcement to report case information to NamUS: a repository dedicated to collecting data on missing, unidentified, or unclaimed persons.(NY, MI, TN, IL, OK, AR, WV, NM, PA, and NC; Spamer et al., 2019). With California not being included in this list, one can assume that missing and murdered indigenous women cases are not prioritized within the government.

          <h3>California Indigenous Feminisms</h3>
              <p>Rooted in the framework of Indigenous feminism is “Counter-colonial Indigenous storytelling. According to Feminist Formations, it is a “ rhetorical practice within indigenous activism that reclaims critical pieces of our histories and identities that are often hidden or erased from dominant discourse within and about indigenous activism”(WhiteBear 2023)  in particular. It is also grounded in the ideals that Indigenous feminism and queer analysis are “intervening to restore balance and healing within indigenous communities”(WhiteBear 2023). This is in contrast to the centuries of settler colonial systems of oppression that have been intentionally forced upon indigenous peoples to disrupt the connections between their land and their identities. Settler violence has shaped how Indigenous people experience feminism. While some indigenous women have asserted that it does not hold a place in indigenous circles, others largely disagree by stating that “feminism drew its roots from Indigenous women’s leadership and autonomy”(WhiteBear 2023). Whitestreamed feminists call for Native communities to be accountable for the way settler violence shows up in their communities due to internalized oppression and lateral violence. Particularly, "The violence towards Indigenous bodies and lands are intertwined and part of the settler colonial paradigm. At its root, Indigenous feminism is about these connections as well as the ways in which settler colonialism has inflicted gendered violence on our bodies and spirits because of who we are as Indigenous people" (Whitebear 2020). All in all, this highlights how the ties between land and bodies are threaded through Native experiences with settler colonial systems.  California Indigenous feminisms ask Native Americans to restore the relationships to their lands, waters, and cultural memories, especially through stories, by countering settler colonial dominance. It asks them to remember they are more than what the settler records depict them as.
              </p>
              <p>Comprehensively, the primal factors for MMIW violence are based upon intimate partner violence, the blatant absence of media representation of these murders, and the continued effect of settler violence on Indigenous communities.
