          <p>Two-Spirit people in the U.S., or Indigenous Americans who identify themselves beyond binary understandings of gender, face discrimination and respond with resistance. ‘Two-Spirit’ is a general term used to describe a variety of third-gender roles in Native American cultures. It comes from the idea that Two-Spirits have both masculine and feminine spirits. However, Two-Spirit identities have much variety, encompassing different sexualities and gender identities.</p>

          <p>Historically, Two-Spirits had specific, often ritual roles in their communities. Many Tribes valued them highly as spiritual leaders. However, in some cultures, Two-Spirits may have been less enthusiastically accepted. Colonization only caused difficulties for these individuals, who did not fit the Western frame of gender. At the same time, their Tribes began to lose connection with parts of their cultures, including the historical roles of Two-Spirits. Because of this, Two-Spirits not only face racism and gender discrimination from White Americans, but also struggle to find acceptance in the wider Native American community. Many Indigenous Americans consider queerness to be a white concept, making Two-Spirits, in their eyes, not truly Native. At the same time, the idea that queerness is white excludes Two-Spirits from the LGBTQ+ community. Because of this double bind, the Gay American Indians and later Two-Spirit movements were created as spaces for community and activism.</a> <!-- This is how you will create a pop-over link for intext citations--></p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <hr>
          <p>Many Native American Tribes have their own traditions surrounding people of non-binary gender roles and identities. Some examples are Blackfeet “manly hearted women,” Plains <em>contraires</em>, and Zuni <em>Ihamana</em> <a href="#References">(Faiman-Silva, 2011)</a>. Cherokee culture includes a third gender role called <em>asegi</em> or <em>asegi udanto</em>. These terms refer to a “different way of thinking, feeling, and being that is outside of men’s and women’s traditional roles” <a href="#References">(Driskill, 2011, p. 98)</a>. Cherokee people of this identity have sometimes been referred to as “Two Heart” <a href="#References">(Driskill, 2011)</a>. Asegi udanto demonstrates the way the Two-Spirit identities reject Western binaries and concepts of gender.</p>
          <p>The idea of “Two-Spirits” as an intertribal concept began with anthropological interest in non-binary gender systems, specifically those with 3, 4, or 5 genders. However, early research was problematic as it focused on historical accounts by Europeans rather than work with Tribes. Because of this, the first term for Two-Spirits in academia was “berdache,” the word that had been used by French explorers <a href="#References">(Chisholm, 2018)</a>. “Berdache” originally comes from Arabic and describes a male prostitute <a href="#References">(Faiman-Silva, 2011)</a>. A later wave of interest in Two-Spirit history came from gender and sexuality scholars looking for historical examples of homosexuality. They classified Indigenous non-binary gender roles as such, mostly ignoring the gender variation of these individuals. During the gay rights movement of the 1960s, the Gay American Indians movement began. This similarly categorized Indigenous people using Western concepts of sexuality.</p>
          <p>In order to recognize the diversity of gender and sexuality in North American Indigenous cultures, the Two-Spirit movement began in the 1990s. This is when the term ‘Two-Spirit’ was created: “‘The term Two Spirit was self-selected in 1990 at the Third annual intertribal Native American/First nations gay and Lesbian gathering in Winnipeg, Canada, based on a calque of many tribal terms, which translate to ‘of two (i.e., female and male) spirits,’” <a href="#References">(Davis, 2019)</a>. However, many early Two-Spirit organizations were still limited by the requirement that the federal funding they received be used to aid “men who have sex with men" during the HIV/AIDs crisis. Some groups found ways around this, while others later expanded to include Indigenous people of other sexualities and gender identities. Since then, groups throughout the U.S. and Canada have been formed. Many participate in both Tribal and Inter-Tribal gatherings and LGBTQ+ events <a href="#References">(Davis, 2019)</a>.</p>

          </figure>
          <p>As stated above, Two-Spirits had accepted roles in many Tribes before colonization. However, <a href="#References">Chisholm (2018)</a> points out that we should shy away from overemphasizing acceptance for several reasons. First, non-binary gender roles are different in every Tribe, and the way that Two-Spirits were historically treated has a lot of variance. Second, this may take away from the modern stigma that Two-Spirits face even within their own communities.<p>
          <p>European colonialists had intensely negative reactions to people who lived outside the system of gender they were used to. Much of the early documentation of Two-Spirits comes from missionaries who were tasked with Christianizing Native Americans by discouraging homosexuality and gender ‘deviance’ <a href="#References">(Faiman-Silva, 2011)</a>. It is clear that from the beginning, Two-Spirits were not respected by Europeans. When U.S. policy turned from eradication of Indigenous communities to assimilation, one part of Native culture that was targeted was non-binary gender roles. Boarding schools were one tactic used. Often founded by the same Christian groups who had targeted Two-Spirits from the beginning, residential schools enforced strict Western gender roles on Indigenous children in Canada and the U.S. Children were placed in these schools by force, and once there, boys’ hair was cut and boys and girls were given gendered dress codes. There was no space for Two-Spirit identification at a boarding school. Sex and gender were treated as one in the same, and children were assigned tasks and classes based on the sex/gender role assigned to them by Europeans <a href="#References">(Depelteau and Giroux, 2022)</a>. In Canada, another issue was the portrayal of legal Indian status by marriage. Under the Indian Act of , Indigenous men passed their status to their wife and children (seen as an extension of the man), no matter the wife’s ethnicity. But, Indigenous women who married non-Native men lost their legal Indian status. While obviously sexist, this policy also denied the existence of Two-Spirit people and made no space for queer relationships. This also completely ignored Indigenous marriage traditions, which were incredibly variable and inclusive <a href="#References">(Depelteau and Giroux, 2022)</a>.</p>
          <p>From this colonial oppression in Indigeneity and Two-Spirit identity came a second source of oppression for Two-Spirits: the Tribes themselves. Western education taught Tribal members that Two-Spirits were sexual sinners, rather than people with unique roles in their communities. Two-Spirit history was erased in many Tribes, so even those who wished to revive cultural traditions often denied traditional multiple-gender systems. For example, one person seeking Two-Spirit history from their elders received the response, “There are no gay Indians. There were never any gay Indians.” <a href="#References">(Faiman-Silva, 2011)</a>. Many Indigenous people took on the attitude that queerness was a concept introduced by Westerners, making Two-Spirits not quite Native in their eyes. This same logic led to the exclusion of Two-Spirits and other queer Indigenous people from the larger LGBTQ+ rights movement in the 1960s and onward.</p>
          <p>In this section, it is noteworthy to highlight the attitudes of media and academic research regarding Two-Spirit Indigenous American people, as extracted from literature. Particularly, Two-Spirit individuals are often portrayed in media and academic discourse through the lens of colonial binaries of sexuality or gender, “neglecting the equal significance of both axes and identity" <a href="#References">(Davis, 2019)</a>. Academic research and media studies frequently urge Two-Spirit individuals to identify themselves outside their community, framing their personal identity as either female or male <a href="#References">(Davis, 2019)</a>. Furthermore, they are often questioned about their identity by researchers and media, attempting to pigeonhole them into categories based on sexuality or gender. However, contrary to these perspectives, there has never been a singular type of body within Two-Spirit regional groups, gatherings, and individual life experiences. Even within a single Indigenous community, significant variation exists across individuals. The Two-Spirit identity and movement unite these diverse practices and experiences across more than 500 nations and communities <a href="#References">(Davis, 2019)</a>. It is pertinent to recognize that there has never been a singular archetype for Two-Spirit individuals within their regional contexts, collective gatherings, or personal narratives. Even within a singular Indigenous community, substantial heterogeneity is observed.</p>

        <h3>Resistance</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>When queer Native Americans did not find a home in the mainstream gay rights movement, they soon began one of their own: the Gay American Indian movement. However, this classified Indigenous people using Western understandings of sexuality, and did not focus much on gender identity. The Two-Spirit movement began in the 1990s, emphasizing non-binary gender traditions rather than just sexuality <a href="#References">(Chisholm, 2018)</a>. The Two-Spirit movement continues to fight violence and discrimination while raising awareness about Indigenous gender systems. As <a href="#References">Davis (2019)</a> writes, Two-Spirits demonstrate refusal of two things: of being a part of Native communities if that means they must be cisgender and heterosexual, and of being a part of the LGBTQ+ community if that means being white.</p>
        <p>Today, Two-Spirit organizations are present across the United States and Canada. Local groups typically convene for regular meetings, various activities, and social events like potluck dinners and birthday parties. They also participate in events within both the Native American community such as Powwows. Equally significant to members and the overall Two-Spirit community are the periodic regional and international gatherings, which draw attendees primarily from the United States and Canada, with occasional participants from Mexico and New Zealand <a href="#References">(Davis, 2019)</a>. Alongside local and regional settings, participants often engage with different Two-Spirit communities in various regions over time, fostering a robust network and a shared sense of unity within local groups and across the broader national and international community.</p>

        <h3>Two-Spirit Organizations</h3>
        <hr>
        <h4><a href="https://2spiritsinmotion.com/">2 Spirits in Motion Society (2SiMS)</a></h4>
          <p>The '2 Spirits in Motion Society' (2SiMS) is a registered national non-profit society incorporated in July 2018 under the relevant society laws of the Government of Canada. The organization is governed by a ten (10) member provisional Board of Directors from various locations throughout Canada. 2SiMS held its first Annual General Meeting (AGM) on January 26, 2020 in Toronto, Ontario during the 2nd Wind Forum on 2 Spirit People. 2SiM was born from discussions at Two Spirits in Motion: the 1st Canadian Forum on 2 Spirit Peoples, HIV/AIDS and Health held in Edmonton, Alberta in February 2003. There were just over 82 delegates at the inaugural Forum where a number of key recommendations were made to advance 2 Spirit community needs and issues in Canada at the national level. Two significant recommendations were to create a national 2 Spirit organization and to continue hosting national Forums on 2 Spirit people.</p>
          <p>2SiMS is a National organization for and by 2 Spirit Peoples across Turtle Island. They aim to express themselves through cultural ways of knowing and being around gender and sexuality; and to succeed and be empowered in all areas that are grounded in the medicines that 2 Spirit people carry from coast to coast to coast.</p>
          <p>2 Spirits in Motion creates, maintains, and strengthens a safe and supportive social environment for 2 Spirit people to feel and be loved, succeed, and become empowered to make their own decisions and to find and express their purpose in life.  Serving as a national sounding board, the organization works to advance the interests of 2 Spirit people.</p>
          <br>
        <h4><a href="https://twospiritmanitoba.ca/">2Spirit Manitoba</a></h4>
          <p>2Spirit Manitoba is an organization that seeks to improve the quality of life of 2Spirit (Indigenous LGBTQQIA+ People).</p>
          <p>Their organization began in 1986 in Winnipeg, when a group of concerned community members came together to support each other and plan community events for their 2Spirit relatives. After many years of small-scale community support, we became a non-profit organization in September 2007. Two-Spirited People of Manitoba is a community-based organization that focuses on helping 2Spirit & Indigenous LGBTQIIA+ holistically improve their circumstances. We currently do this by providing awareness workshops, advocating to prevent homo/transphobia and other forms of discrimination, hosting community events, as well as collaborating and partnering with other organizations and initiatives to enhance their services.</p>
          <p>The first Native American Gay and Lesbian gathering was held in Minneapolis in the summer of 1988. It was decided then that future gatherings would be held in natural spaces as opposed to urban centers. Since then we have traveled across North American to honor Two-Spirit people in their traditional territories. In this way, we reclaim our sacred roles and spaces.</p>
          <p>The term ‘Two-Spirit’ was introduced at the third annual international LGBT Native American gathering in 1990. Elder Myra Laramee shared the name and it was quickly adopted as a spirit-name. Today, Indigenous LGBTQQIA+ and Two-Spirit are terms chosen by some Indigenous people to describe an aspect of their identity.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.baaits.org/">Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirits (BAAITS)</a></h4>

            </figure>
          <p>BAAITS is a volunteer organization rooted in the community, providing culturally appropriate events for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex Native Americans, along with their families and friends. The term 'Two-Spirit' reflects a traditional belief in many Native American Tribes that certain individuals embody both masculine and feminine spiritual qualities. In mainstream American society, Two-Spirit People are often labeled as Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, or Transgender. Bay Area American Indian Two-Spirits (BAAITS) gathers to connect, socialize, and build networks in a setting free from alcohol and drugs. BAAITS aims to create a safe space where Two-Spirit individuals can embrace their cultural roots. With this goal in mind, BAAITS is dedicated to providing culturally meaningful events for LGBTQ individuals of Native American descent, as well as their loved ones.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>
        <h4><a href="https://www.mttwospirit.org/">Montana Two-Spirit Society</a></h4>
          <p>They promote understanding of Two-Spirit and Native LGBTQ+ concerns through presentations, marches, involvement in regional Two-Spirit gatherings, and advocacy for 2SLGBTQ+ rights at demonstrations. Additionally, they collaborate with local organizations like All Nations Health Center and the Western Montana LGBTQ Community Center to form alliances and partnerships.</p>
          <p>Their primary aim is to unite our community in solidarity and education. They believe that gathering as a community is vital for promoting health, wellness, and resilience. To achieve this, they organize events such as our annual Gathering, participate in other Two-Spirit gatherings and powwows, collaborate with community partners to host events, and establish safe spaces where Two-Spirit individuals can come together and feel supported.</p>
          <br>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>In summary, 'Two-Spirit' serves as a broad term encompassing various third-gender roles found within Native American societies. The concept of ‘Two-Spirits’ as a cross-Tribal notion originated from anthropological inquiry into non-binary gender frameworks, particularly those featuring three, four, or five distinct genders. Those in the United States who identify as Two-Spirit or as Indigenous Americans rejecting traditional binary gender norms often encounter discrimination and react by resisting such marginalization. Before colonization, Two-Spirits held recognized and accepted roles in numerous Native American tribes, as mentioned earlier. <a href="#References">Chisholm (2018)</a> points out the importance of avoiding an overemphasis on acceptance, however, for several reasons. The oppression of Indigenous peoples and Two-Spirit identities by colonial forces led to a secondary source of oppression for Two-Spirits: their own Tribes. Today, Two-Spirit organizations are present across the United States and Canada. Individuals often connect with different Two-Spirit communities across various regions over time. This fosters a strong network and a shared sense of unity within local groups as well as across the broader national and international community. To illustrate, 2 Spirits in Motion Society is a national organization created by and for Two-Spirit individuals across Turtle Island. Their goal is to express themselves through cultural methods of understanding and embracing gender and sexuality. In addition, 2Spirit Manitoba is an organization dedicated to enhancing the quality of life for 2Spirit individuals, who are Indigenous members of the LGBTQQIA+ community. Their main objective is to foster solidarity and provide educational resources within our community. They firmly believe that coming together as a community is crucial for promoting health, well-being, and resilience. These organizations are emblematic of the strength Two-Spirit people have shown, carving a place for themselves in the face of marginalization.</p>
